%%%%Data description%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Source: 
All data is extracted from: https://transparency.entsoe.eu/dashboard/show

%Data Files:
1) Actual generation per production type (generation profile)
2) Day-ahead prices
3) Generation forecasts for wind and solar (DA,Intra, Actual)
4) Imbalance amount and prices (both direction +/-)
5) Total Load - Day Ahead & Actual

%Resolution: 
Hourly from 01.01.2020-31.03.2020
So clean up necessary. Think we consider 3 weeks. From 01.03-28.03.20

%Spatial context: 
Just looking on the GB-bidding zone

%General comments: 
- Data quality sometimes bad. So be careful. (example:  actual solar generation in the "solar and wind forecast" file is misleading)
